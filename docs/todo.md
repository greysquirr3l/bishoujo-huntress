# Bishoujo-Huntress: Implementation Todo List

## Open Items

### Whatâ€™s Missing or Incomplete (vs. Huntress API Docs/Swagger)

- [ ] **User Invitations**
  - [ ] No explicit invite user method yet

### Features/Enhancements (vs. Huntress API Docs/Swagger)

- [ ] **Strict Model Validation**
  - [ ] Ensure all request/response models match the latest Swagger schema (field types, required/optional, enums).
  - [ ] Some fields may be missing or have different types (e.g., time.Time vs. string).
- [x] **Enum Types**
  - [x] Go enums are now used for all major fields with limited values (incident status, agent platform, report type, webhook event type, etc.)
- [ ] **OpenAPI/Swagger Codegen**
  - [ ] Consider using Swagger/OpenAPI codegen to cross-check your models and endpoints for completeness and accuracy.

### Mock Generation & Testing

- [x] **Manual/Testify Mock Implementations**
  - [x] Interfaces are mocked using hand-written or testify-based mocks in test files.
  - [x] No use of Mockery or auto-generated mocks; mocks are maintained alongside tests.
  - [x] All critical interfaces have corresponding test mocks for unit and integration testing.

- [x] Advanced filtering in all list methods (date ranges, enums, search, tags) implemented and tested
- [x] Error handling reviewed and updated for context and mapping
- [x] Complete bulk, audit log, and integration adapters
- [x] Add user invitation helpers (helpers scaffolded, API endpoint pending)
- [x] Request tracing and response caching implemented (optional, can be toggled)
- [x] Huntress API Swagger/OpenAPI spec reviewed for new endpoints or changes (as of May 2025)
- [x] Prioritize missing endpoints and features based on user needs and Huntress API changes
- [x] DDD, CQRS, and Clean Architecture followed as described in `docs/`
- [x] All new code is covered by unit and integration tests
- [x] Documentation and examples up to date as new features are added
- [x] Swagger/OpenAPI spec regularly reviewed for new endpoints or changes

### Linting Automation

- [x] `golangci-lint` installation is now automated in the Makefile and documented in the README. The Makefile will install the correct version if not present in your `$PATH`.
