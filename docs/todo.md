# Bishoujo-Huntress: Implementation Todo List

## Open Items

### Whatâ€™s Missing or Incomplete (vs. Huntress API Docs/Swagger)

- [ ] **User Invitations**
  - [ ] No explicit invite user method yet
- [ ] **API Versioning**
  - [ ] Version field present, explicit switching/custom headers not yet implemented
- [ ] **Request Tracing**
  - [ ] No explicit support for request tracing (e.g., correlation IDs, OpenTelemetry)
- [ ] **Testing/Mocking**
  - [ ] No explicit test helpers or mock server for simulating Huntress API responses

### Features/Enhancements (vs. Huntress API Docs/Swagger)

- [ ] **Strict Model Validation**
  - [ ] Ensure all request/response models match the latest Swagger schema (field types, required/optional, enums).
  - [ ] Some fields may be missing or have different types (e.g., time.Time vs. string).
- [ ] **Enum Types**
  - [ ] Use Go enums for fields with limited values (e.g., incident status, agent platform).
- [ ] **OpenAPI/Swagger Codegen**
  - [ ] Consider using Swagger/OpenAPI codegen to cross-check your models and endpoints for completeness and accuracy.

### Next Steps

- Expand advanced filtering in all list methods (date ranges, enums, search, tags)
- Review and update error handling for context and mapping
- Complete bulk, audit log, and integration adapters
- Add user invitation helpers
- Add request tracing and response caching (optional)
- Periodically review the Huntress API Swagger/OpenAPI spec for new endpoints or changes
- Prioritize missing endpoints and features based on user needs and Huntress API changes
- Continue to follow DDD, CQRS, and Clean Architecture as described in `docs/`
- Ensure all new code is covered by unit and integration tests
- Keep documentation and examples up to date as new features are added
- Regularly review the Swagger/OpenAPI spec for new endpoints or changes
