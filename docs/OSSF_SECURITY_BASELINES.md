# OSSF Security Baselines

This document provides guidance on implementing security practices aligned with the Open Source Security Foundation (OSSF) security baselines for open source projects.

## üîê Core Security Principles

The OSSF security baselines focus on these key areas:

1. **Code Security**
2. **Dependency Management**
3. **Build & Release Security**
4. **Vulnerability Disclosure**
5. **Security Testing**
6. **Documentation**

## üìã Security Baseline Checklist

### Code Security

- [ ] **Secure Coding Practices**

  - Maintain security assumptions

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Guidelines

### Starting Small

1. Begin with basic security hygiene:
   - Enable branch protection
   - Add a SECURITY.md file
   - Set up automated dependency scanning

2. Progress to intermediate measures:
   - Implement automated security testing
   - Sign releases
   - Create a vulnerability management process

3. Advanced security measures:
   - Generate and publish SBOMs
   - Implement fuzzing
   - Conduct regular security audits

## Tool Recommendations

### General Purpose Tools

```bash
# Dependency scanning
$ dependency-check --project "Project Name" --scan /path/to/code

# Secret scanning
$ git-secrets --scan

#### Semgrep (SAST)

This project uses [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/) for static application security testing (SAST). The recommended version is **v1.119.0** (pinned in CI and `ossf-attest.sh`).

To run Semgrep locally:

```bash
brew install semgrep  # or pipx install semgrep==1.119.0
semgrep --config p/owasp-top-ten .
```

Semgrep is also run automatically in CI and as part of the OSSF attestation script (`ossf-attest.sh`).

#### SBOM generation

$ syft /path/to/project -o cyclonedx-json > sbom.json

### Language-Specific Tools

Different tools are recommended based on programming language:

- **Go**: gosec, govulncheck
- **JavaScript/Node.js**: npm audit, eslint-plugin-security
- **Python**: bandit, safety
- **Java**: SpotBugs, OWASP Dependency Check
- **Ruby**: Brakeman, bundler-audit
- **Rust**: cargo-audit, cargo-deny

## üìä Assessment & Improvement

### Measuring Security Maturity

The OSSF provides tools to assess your project's security posture:

- [OSSF Scorecard](https://securityscorecards.dev/): Automated checks for security best practices
- [OpenSSF Best Practices Badge Program](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/): A way to show your project follows best practices

### Continuous Improvement

- Regularly review security posture
- Subscribe to security advisories for your dependencies
- Participate in security-focused communities
- Consider having periodic external security reviews

## üß™ How to Test OSSF Security Baselines Locally (macOS)

To verify your adherence to the OSSF Security Baselines, run the following checks locally:

### 1. Static Analysis & Linting

- Run `make lint` to check for code quality, security, and style issues (uses `golangci-lint` with security linters enabled).
- If you do not have `golangci-lint` installed, the Makefile will install it automatically (see README for details).
- Run `gosec ./...` for Go security static analysis.
- Run `govulncheck ./...` for Go vulnerability scanning.

### 2. Dependency Scanning

- Run `go mod tidy` to ensure dependencies are clean and minimal.
- Run `govulncheck ./...` to check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.

### 3. Secret Scanning

- Install [git-secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets) and scan for secrets:

```bash
brew install git-secrets
git secrets --scan
```

### 4. SBOM Generation

This project uses [syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft) **v1.23.1** for SBOM generation. Please use this version for reproducibility and OSSF Scorecard compliance.

Install syft v1.23.1 (recommended):

```bash
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anchore/syft/main/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin v1.23.1
syft --version  # should print syft 1.23.1
syft . -o cyclonedx-json > sbom.json
```

### 5. Test Coverage

- Run `make test` to execute all tests and check for high coverage, especially on critical code paths.

### 6. CI/CD Verification

- Ensure your GitHub Actions workflow runs all of the above on every PR.

### 7. Security Policy

- Confirm that [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) is present and up to date.

### 8. Testify Adherence

- Save the output of the above tools (e.g., `gosec`, `govulncheck`, `git secrets`, `syft`) as text files:
  - `gosec.txt`, `govulncheck.txt`, `git-secrets.txt`, `sbom.json`
- Attach these files to a security review or upload as CI artifacts.
- For each checkbox in this document, add a comment or evidence (e.g., filename, summary, or link to artifact) showing how it is satisfied.
- Example:
  - `[x] Secure Coding Practices  # see gosec.txt, govulncheck.txt`
  - `[x] Dependency Verification  # see sbom.json, govulncheck.txt`
  - `[x] Secret Scanning  # see git-secrets.txt`
- Optionally, add a section at the end of this file summarizing the evidence and linking to the artifacts.

---

#### Example: Saving Evidence

```bash
# Run and save outputs
make lint > golangci-lint.txt
make test > test-results.txt
gosec ./... > gosec.txt
govulncheck ./... > govulncheck.txt
git secrets --scan > git-secrets.txt
syft . -o cyclonedx-json > sbom.json
```
